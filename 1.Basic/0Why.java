/*
Why should we use java?

=> it is platform independent. (platform means windows+intel, windows+amd, linux+amd). bcz java make its code into BYTECODE and then most machines have JVM which is responsible for running byte code in a machine
=> simple compilation but complex running process than c/c++
=> not have concepts like pointers, operator overloading that makes it simple
=> unlike python you need to declare variable type which make program faster
